    <h1 class="space">Dear God by XTC</h1>
    <div class="text">
    <p><span class="highlight">Dear God</span>, hope you got the letter and</p>
    <p>I pray you can make it better down here</p>
    <p>I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer</p>
    <p>But all the people that you made in your image</p>
    <p>See them starving on their feet</p>
    <p>Cause they don't get enough to eat from God</p>


<h2>I can't believe in you</h2>

<p><span class="highlight">Dear God</span>, sorry to disturb you but</p>
<p>I feel that I should be heard loud and clear</p>
<p>We all need a big reduction in amount of tears</p>
<p>And all the people that you made in your image</p>
<p>See them fighting in the street</p>
<p>Cause they can't make opinions meet about God</p>

<h2>They can't believe in you</h2>

<p>Did you make disease and the diamond blue?</p>
<p>Did you make mankind after we made you?</p>

<h2>And the devil too!</h2>

<p><span class="highlight">Dear God</span>, don't know if you noticed but</p>
<p>Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book</p>
<p>And us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look</p>
<p>And all the people that you made in your image</p>
<p>Still believing that junk is true</p>
<p>Well I know it ain't, so do you</p>
<p><span class="highlight">Dear God</span></p>

<h2>I can't believe in...</h2>
<h2>I don't believe in...</h2>

<p>I won't believe in heaven and hell</p>
<p>No saints, no sinners, no devil as well</p>
<p>The pearly gates, no thorny crown</p>
<p>You're always letting us humans down</p>
<p>The wars you bring, the babes you drown</p>
<p>Those lost at sea and never found</p>
<p>And it's the same the whole world round</p>
<p>The hurt I see helps to compound</p>
<p>The Father, Son, and holy ghost</p>
<p>Is just somebody's unholy hoax</p>
<p>And if you're up there you'll perceive</p>
<p>That my heart's here upon my sleeve</p>
<p>If there's one thing I don't believe in</p>

<h2>It's you</h2>
